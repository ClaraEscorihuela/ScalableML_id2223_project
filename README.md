# id2223_project

Scalable Machine Learning and Deep Learning Project Course conducted at KTH. 

The project aims at detecting the absence of the exon-intron boundary regions in DNA by using the Chaos
Game Theory (CGT) to transform a DNA sequence into a 3D image, and a Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
to determine the presence or fault of the sequence.
